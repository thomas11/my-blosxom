### Documentation:
#
# This is a plugin for blosxom.
#
# Installation:
#
#  Just drop it into your blosxoms plugin directory and it should start
#  working. It needs a symbolic link supporting operating system, so it
#  may not work under Windows. Unices should work fine, if you don't do
#  ugly things with file systems. ;-)
# 
# What it does:
#
#  It allows to have postings in multiple categories without having
#  them multiple times on the main page or any category's page which
#  includes at least two categories, the posting appears in. Designed
#  to work together with categorytree, which still counts all
#  occurrences of a posting.
#
# Plugin Order:
#
#  If you change the plugin order and have the categorytree plugin
#  installed, it must come before multcat to work as intended.
#
#  If you have the moreentries plugin installed, you may change it's
#  position in the plugin order to run after multcat.
#
# Version History:
#
#  0.01: Initial release
#
