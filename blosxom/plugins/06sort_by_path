=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: sort_by_path

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sorts Weblog entries by path rather than in the default reverse-chronological
order.

Use in concert with an appropriate "date" replacement, using path instead
of date as the divider.  E.g.:  <p><b>$path</b></p>

Overrides Blosxom's default sort() subroutine.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Drop the sort_by_default  plug-in into your Blosxom plugins folder.
