- sorting and creating the archive pages by mtime makes no sense. do
  it based on either filename or meta:date tag.

- little welcome blurb on the home page? would require hacking as
  putting it in header.html would show it on each article page, too.

- make a footer with a little "about" info and links. maybe licensing,
  too?

- DONE write about.html

- DONE write a little blurb for the front page

- DONE make a little Perl thing (Plack, Dancer?) that serves the
  static files so that absolute links work.

- DONE list entries in newest-first order on front page
